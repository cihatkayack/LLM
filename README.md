# Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)

Welcome to the **Large Language Model (LLM) Learning Notebooks**!  
This repository provides a step-by-step, practical guide to understanding and working with LLMs, with a focus on GPT-2 architecture, tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation techniques.

## Getting Started

You can easily run the notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) without any local setup:

1. Open the notebooks with Google Colab.
2. Install necessary libraries if prompted.
3. Follow the sections, run the code, and complete the exercises.
